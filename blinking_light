description: the led blinks very fast
             when you change the 220µF capacitor to a 1000µF capacitor, the led blinks slower. (1s light, 0.5s no light)
             when you change the 220µF capacitor to a 2200µF capacitor, the led blinks even slower. (2s light, 1s no light)
             when you change the 470 ohm resistors to 500k ohm resistors, the led does not blink at all, it is lit.
             when you pull out both resistors, the led does not blink at all, it is lit.
