description: the led blinks very fast

experiments:
             when you change the 220µF capacitor to a 1000µF capacitor, the led blinks slower. (1s light, 0.5s no light)
             
             when you change the 220µF capacitor to a 2200µF capacitor, the led blinks even slower. (2s light, 1s no light)
             
             when you change the 470 ohm resistors to 10 ohm resistors, the led does not light at all.
             it flashes once when turned on and only very weak. (like if it does not have enough voltage)
             
             when you change the 470 ohm resistors to 500k ohm resistors, the led does not blink at all, it is lit.
             
             when you pull out both resistors, the led does not blink at all, it is lit.
           
             when you switch the resistor from pin 6 to 7 of the 555 to a 5,6k ohm resistor instead of the previous 470 ohm resistor
             the led will blink slower. (approximatelly 2s light, 1s no light)

             when you switch the led with a printer motor (~1,5 forward voltage) the motor did behave weird, after I gave it a push
             it started to run and did not stop anymore.
