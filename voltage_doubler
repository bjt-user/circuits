power source: 9V DC

555 timer (NA555P):
  plus terminal -> 8
  minus terminal -> 1
  2 -> 6 (jumper wire)
  4 -> 8 (jumper wire)
  2 -> 3 (resistor R1 15k ohm)
  
capacitor (100µF): (C1)
  minus terminal -> - of the capacitor (anode)
  + of the capacitor (cathode) -> 2 of the 555 timer
  
parallel to 8 and 3 of the NA555P:
  8 -> + of diode D1 (cathode)
  - of diode D1 (anode) -> + of capacitor C2 (cathode) (47µF)
  - of capacitor C2 (anode) (47µF) -> resistor (100 ohm)
  resistor (100 ohm) -> 3 of the NA555P
  
parallel to C2 and the minus terminal:
  + of C2 -> + of diode D2
  - of D2 -> + of C3 (330µF 400V)
  - of C3 -> minus terminal
  
  
  notes:
    "minus terminal" means minus terminal of the battery
    "plus terminal" means plus terminal of the battery
    on horizontal capacitors the - (anode) is where the arrow with the minus in it is pointing to
    in the original schematic C3 is 470µF and R1 is only 10k ohm
    
    
  result:
    you can get almost the double of the input voltage on C3 (14-15V after some time)
    the two diodes consume about 0,7V each and the timer takes 1,7V away
    if you take the power supply away and connect the leads of C3 together a small spark will be visible
